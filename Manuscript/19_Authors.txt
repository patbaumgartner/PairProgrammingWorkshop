# About the authors {#Authors}

**Yves Hanoulle:**

I started working in IT in 1994. I worked as software support, developer, team lead, trainer, agile coach. I believe that IT is mainly about working with people. A skill that can never be learned enough. 

Yearly I spend at least 10 % of my revenue on training and books (You can find details and recommendations on my linkedin profile.)


After my father invented the term PairCoaching, I started to use it to  promote pairwork.
When I don’t work as an agile coach helping companies in EMEA, talking at conferences around the world about agile or the core protcols, I’m using
agile idea’s to raise my 3 kids. (And I use what I learn from them when I work with teams.)

Since December 2012, I work from a [walking desk](http://www.hanoulle.be/2013/02/im-working-from-a-walking-desk/).
