#Feedback {#Feedback}

During the feedback section, you want to encourage participants to give each other feedback about how they are affected by each other and by their working relationships. This is a skill you can teach participants and encourage them to take away with them.

Feedback on the first level consists of explaining what you see, hear and feel. On the second level, feedback is about explaining what the behavior of another person does to you.

**Example:** 

I saw that your eyes looked angry (notice that this is already an interpretation, see earlier) and your mouth was trembling (this is the first level). This anger made me feel afraid (second level).

In these two levels no evaluation occurs! So, the final step (evaluation) is to make suggestions for how things could be changed in order to improve them.

The effect of the feedback, even on the first level, is surprisingly strong. The other person feels “seen”. Their existence is acknowledged much more than usual.

The second level of feedback is very good for improving relationships: When I tell another person what their behavior does to me, they understand what is happening, and we are on our way to a real authentic relationship. Even if I say really challenging things to the other person, this usually enhances the relationship. In a lot of situations people avoid this, because they want to ‘save’ the other person. We are often afraid to be honest in our relationships.

We are showing our vulnerabilities, and the reactions of other people to this can be stressful.

### Real relationships aren't smooth

Feedback can be given both verbally and non-verbally. It can be positive and negative. Feedback can be given on content or relational aspects of a communication.

**Example:**

Ben works very precisely and cleans everything up.

Jan gives feedback:

+ I notice that you paid attention to this and to that, and that you cleaned up (content feedback).
+ Your work is finished in great detail (This is already more about value than content, and is mainly relational feedback).
+ I experience this as very pleasant, because I feel secure that your work will be great without me having to try and influence it. (Relational feedback on the second level: Jan tells how that makes him feels)

### Feedback steps:

+ I see, I hear, ... (facts)
+ I interpret, think, feel... (interpret)
+ I feel myself (feeling), I experience
+ I wish, I hope, I want (evaluation)

**Example:** 

"You said that the file was ok, and it’s not, because it has these things wrong with it."

**Remark:** 

If you say here “you are a liar”, that is that by our definition not feedback. It is more a reproach: a reproach is partly feedback (you did something), but there is also a suggestion that the person should have done it differently (a negative evaluation). Saying “you are a liar” is even more than that: It is an insult, a disapproval of the whole person. It should therefore be avoided. 

When you have a problem with something the other person has done, remember to try and describe what your experience is and how it has affected you. Then see whether you can come up with a positive suggestion (an evaluation) for how a change could be made.
