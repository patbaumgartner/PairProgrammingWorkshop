# Observation {#Observation}

This section gives some tips about how to observe the behaviour of your workshop participants. The idea is that if you are skilled in observation, then you can observe the participants, but that you can also teach them to observe themselves and each other.

Observing is unnatural for most people. We’re used to participating in a conversation. Sometimes we react without thinking. Sometimes we speak without listening. When we observe, we do the opposite. The great thing about observing is that you can learn it by just doing it. The hard part is that you have to do it a lot.

## Exercise to do at home

You can practice by looking at pictures. Take any picture out of the newspaper. Describe the surroundings. The people, the interaction between the people. When you observe, try keeping the following things in mind: What you see, what you interpret, and what you feel, In other words try starting your sentences with:

+ I see / I hear ... 
+ or I interpret... 
+ or I feel ...

### Examples

+ **"Interpretation":** It is night. Observation: I see a dark environment. I interpret this as being night.

+ **"Interpretation":** Person X is mad. Observation: I see that person X has a strange face. I interpret that he is mad.

+ **"Feeling":** I feel my stomach hurts when I look at him. 

This last example is an internal observation. Its main value is to learn more about yourself, and to understand why you react to something.

Don’t ignore your feelings when you are observing. Write down what you feel and try to understand where this is coming from. Sometimes your subconscious mind is telling you something you don’t know yet.

Example: There is a section in the movie Disclosure, where Tom Sander (Michael Douglas) stops in the middle of sex. When he later listens to a recording of the event, he realizes that his partner was coughing at a moment she would not normally cough. That made him realize she played and planned it all. His subconscious mind had already noticed it, he just could not see it clearly at the time.

### As an exercise it is very interesting to limit your observations.

**Examples:**
+ Only listen: Observe a conversation blindfolded.
+ Only watch: Observe the body language, but don’t listen (listen to music instead).
+ Observe only specific interactions between people, for example try to see who ignores the leader.
+ Check to see whether body language is congruent with what people are saying.
+ Are they touching each other?
+ What distance is there between the people?
+ Are they looking into each other’s eyes?
+ Do they laugh a lot?
+ What do you notice about the noise they make?
